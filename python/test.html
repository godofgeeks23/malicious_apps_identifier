****************************************************
Customers applying for a Personal Loan should note that:

• Unlike other loans, Personal Loans usually have a shorter repayment tenure, ranging from 3 months to 5 years

• Depending upon the individual applicant's profile and the lender, the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of a personal loan may vary from 10.99% to 35%

• For example, on a personal loan of Rs. 4.5 lakh at an interest rate of 15.5% with repayment tenure of 3 years, the EMI will be Rs. 15,710. The total payout here would be:

Principal Amount: Rs 4,50,000
Interest Charges (@15.5%): Rs 1,15,560
Loan Processing Fees (@2%): Rs 9000
Documentation charges: Rs 500
Amortization Schedule charges: Rs 200
Total cost of the loan: Rs 5,75,260

• However, in case of change of payment mode or any delay or non-payment of EMIs, additional charges / penal charges may also be applicable, depending on the lender's policy

• Also depending upon the lender, prepayment options may or may not be available and applicable charges for the same may vary.</p>
