  comments: [
    "The new (ish) interface isn't great. It seems undesirable to have a giant place to type something to translate. It seems more useful to show your translate history. I also liked how before, you could see the phonetic pronunciation as well as the character for Chinese, for example. Now you have to click on it to see that which is an extra step",
    "It used to be really good smooth transitions easy to translate back and forth with suggested button clicks. Deleting your history so you can free up space was very easy. Now you have to jump through five different screens to delete your history and whenever you're translate you have to click three or four different things just to translate every single time. Thinking of uninstalling it permanently this new update is terrible. I wish they would bring back some of the old features.",
    "I don't know what they're thinking here with this application but the previous iteration of this app was perfectly fine and worked really well. Translations weren't the best sometimes and, I don't know...maybe you developers should concentrate on THAT. Not always is it good to change in app and relocate everything. It was very easy to use and everything was there available including history which you could just scroll down to see. I expect to see your canned, condescending response below....",
    "The update has made the app unusable. The tap to translate function used to be just copying a sentence and then tapping the floating icon and it would translate to the desired language immediately. Now you have to copy the sentence tab the floating icon and then go in and clear the last sentence translated, paste the new sentence and then hit another button to get it translated. It doesn't work. When you're having a WhatsApp or text message conversation, It takes too long now. Too many steps.",
    "This app was flawless before they redesigned the interface. Several key features were removed, at the expense of the new design. What a waste. Don't even bother with this app. Edit: Nevermind. I was able to find my favorite features such as translate using camera or import an image to translate from. They were just hard to find at first, but the app is still good. Definitely recommend."
